# Bankfull-geometry-of-floodplain-secondary-channels
The jupyter notebook accompanies a manuscript and processes elevation data along channel transects to extract bankfull dimensions.
This code was developed based on the algorithm described by Lindroth et al. (2020): Spatial Variability in Bankfull Stage and Bank Elevations of Lowland Meandering Rivers: Relation to Rating Curves and Channel Planform Characteristics.
The steps to extract transect x and y (distance vs elevation) data through lidar data is presented in the first cell.
